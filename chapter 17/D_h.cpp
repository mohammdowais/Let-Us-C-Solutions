/*
Linked list is a very common data structure that is often used to
store similar data in memory. The individual elements of a linked
list are stored “somewhere” in memory. The order of the elements
is maintained by explicit links between them. Thus, a linked list is a
collection of elements called nodes, each of which stores two item
of information—an element of the list, and a link, i.e., a pointer or
an address that indicates explicitly the location of the node
containing the successor of this list element.
Write a program to build a linked list by adding new nodes at the
beginning, at the end or in the middle of the linked list. Also write a
function display( ) which displays all the nodes present in the linked
list.
